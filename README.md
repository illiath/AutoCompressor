AutoCompressor
==============

Minecraft mod that provides an RF-powered block compressor.

The mod is currently undergoing development, until the core is done, please don't complain at me if the mod doesn't work, or if it works in a manner you don't like or anything else.

At this time, the mod is NOT for general release, heck, I'm fairly sure I have useless code, extra stuff, and the mod will explode horribly and eat your cat, goldfish, server, or anything else it can get it's hands on, it is well in pre-alpha at this point.

Notes on Code Comparisons
=========================
Segments of the code will appear similar to other mod authors code, some of this is due to the inability for there to be multiple ways to do a specific task, others are because I have looked at other code to see how they have done things. If you believe some of this code is a direct rip-off of your code and is in violation of copyright/common-decency please contact me privately and we can discuss how I came up with that specific piece of code, I will happily remove something that is possible to be done multiple ways if the code is in violation of a copyright or if another mod author published the code but does not wish me to use it for any reason.

At no point do I claim to have ownership of code I did not write myself, and as the mod is not officially released, don't come whining about copyright or anything else until I do release it (if ever), as I am using github as my source code repository for this mod, NOT as a method of release, and I'm too cheap to get an account that lets me hide my source code.
